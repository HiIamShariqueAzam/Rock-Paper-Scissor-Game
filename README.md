Developed a Rock-Paper-Scissor game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where the user plays against the computer. The game randomly selects the computerâ€™s choice, compares
it with the user's choice, and updates the score accordingly. It provides instant feedback with color-coded messages (green for win, red for loss, black for draw),
ensuring an engaging user experience.
